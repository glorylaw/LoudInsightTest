Understanding the Event Loop:
console.log statements: These execute synchronously and are immediately printed to the console.

fs.promises.readFile: This is an asynchronous operation that will read a file, and when complete, it schedules its .then() block to be executed, which will print the message for the bard.

setTimeout: A callback is scheduled to run after at least 0 milliseconds. However, it doesn't execute immediately; it goes to the task queue after the current phase completes.

process.nextTick: This method schedules the callback to run after the current operation but before any I/O events or timers (like setTimeout). It has the highest priority.

Expected Execution Order:
"The King has entered the court": Synchronously executed first.
"The court session has ended": Synchronously executed second.
"Your Majesty, thereâ€™s an urgent matter": This process.nextTick is executed after the synchronous code and before any asynchronous tasks.
"The jester performs an act": The setTimeout callback is queued to execute after the next tick (process.nextTick) and before asynchronous file reading.
"The bard sings a song": The file reading completes last in the event loop after all other synchronous tasks and timers.

Final Output:
The King has entered the court,
The court session has ended,
Your Majesty, thereâ€™s an urgent matter,
The jester performs an act,
The bard sings a song:  La la la la...lololololol ðŸŽ¶

Why They Appear in This Order:
Synchronous tasks (console.log statements) run in the order they appear in the code.
process.nextTick runs immediately after the synchronous code completes, but before anything else in the event loop (i.e., before asynchronous tasks).
setTimeout with a 0 ms delay is added to the task queue after process.nextTick, so it runs after that.
File reading (fs.promises.readFile) is the most delayed task because it's an asynchronous operation, and its completion triggers a .then() callback after all other tasks in the event loop.
By understanding the event loop and prioritization of tasks like process.nextTick and setTimeout, we can predict the output order and structure the message flow correctly.

Explanation of the Output

Synchronous Code:
"The King has entered the court" and "The court session has ended" are logged first because synchronous operations are executed before anything else.
process.nextTick:

The king's advisor whispers immediately after the current synchronous operations are complete because process.nextTick callbacks are prioritized over other asynchronous operations.

setTimeout:
The jester's act (callback with setTimeout) is scheduled in the Timers Phase of the event loop and executed after process.nextTick.

fs.promises.readFile:
The bard sings last because fs.promises.readFile is a file system operation that uses the Poll Phase of the event loop. It resolves after all other pending tasks in the event loop.


Key Concepts
Microtasks vs. Macrotasks:

process.nextTick is a microtask, which runs before moving to the next phase of the event loop.
setTimeout is a macrotask, which executes in the Timers Phase.

Phases of the Event Loop:
Timers
Pending Callbacks
Idle/Prepare
Poll (I/O events)
Check (e.g., setImmediate)
Close Callbacks
This ordering ensures the proper functioning of the Node.js asynchronous model and explains why the announcements appear in the observed sequence.
